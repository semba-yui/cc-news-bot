## rust-v0.161.0 (2026-10-07T15:58:45Z)
## New Features

- GPT-6.1 Sol is now the default model in the bundled and Amazon Bedrock catalogs. (#49318, #49339)
- Amazon Bedrock supports multi-agent V2 and Ultra reasoning on compatible models; Bedrock Mantle also accepts AWS GovCloud regions. (#49345, #49813)
- Sign in to MCP servers from an active terminal session with `/mcp login <name>`. (#49290)
- Choose your microphone, speaker, and microphone input channels for voice conversations, with preferences saved locally. (#49437, #49836)
- Daybreak is opt-in through `--enable cli_daybreak` or `features.cli_daybreak=true`; `daybreak=true` alone is insufficient. By default, controls and indicators are hidden, `/daybreak` is unavailable, and automatic Cyber routing is omitted—even for saved Daybreak threads. Saved preferences remain intact. Opt-in routing requires eligible ChatGPT sign-in, the OpenAI provider, and advertised model/program support. (#49856, #49858, #49859, #49861, #51207)
- Select a Cyber access program per turn with `codex exec --cyber-access-program` or the TypeScript SDK’s `cyberAccessProgram` option. The explicit exec override remains available with `cli_daybreak` disabled and leaves the saved choice unchanged. (#49939, #51207)

## Bug Fixes

- Approved filesystem escalation can now grant broader write access while preserving denied reads and network restrictions. Background tasks retain their originating turn’s permissions. (#49353, #49880)
- Explicit launch permissions survive terminal reconnects and new sessions, while implicit client settings no longer overwrite server or saved-thread web-search settings. (#49809, #49799)
- Elevated Windows terminal sessions can start using an embedded server, and sandboxed PowerShell preserves relative paths beneath protected user profiles. (#49855, #49690)
- Enter correctly submits buffered input after paste detection expires, including in Vim insert mode. (#49810)
- Thread resume includes the latest committed history. Startup detects recoverable SQLite corruption earlier and preserves damaged databases as backups. (#49599, #49701)
- Responses retries and WebSocket-to-HTTP fallback honor server retry guidance, reducing premature failures during overload. (#49441)

## Documentation

- Authentication guidance now accounts for keyring storage instead of implying credentials always reside in `auth.json`. (#49361)

## Chores

- Publishing an older alpha or hotfix no longer moves npm alpha tags backward. (#49704)
