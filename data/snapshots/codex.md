## rust-v0.151.0 (2026-08-29T09:55:39Z)
## New Features

- Added a configurable grace period for discovering tools from optional MCP servers. (#41199)
- Extensions can now inspect or replace MCP tool results before they reach the model. (#41202)
- Plugin catalogs now combine per-repository configuration and report invalid project marketplaces without hiding valid plugins. (#41208)

## Bug Fixes

- Preserved restored permission profiles across TUI turns and prevented `/cd` from weakening sandbox restrictions. (#41192)
- Kept tool availability and reasoning effort correct when switching models or falling back to another model. (#41195, #41206)
- Improved remote sandbox enforcement using the executor’s actual home directory, operating system, and path conventions. (#41196, #41204, #41207, #41209)
- Preserved structured MCP tool and resource errors in app-server responses. (#41196)
- Counted nested subagent token usage toward root goal budgets. (#41183)
- Prevented stale Guardian classifications from authorizing actions after permission state changes. (#41196)

## Chores

- Added telemetry for escalated stdin reviews and remote executor MCP discovery. (#41189, #41205)
- Stabilized Guardian WebSocket and core fixture tests under slow or highly concurrent CI. (#41191, #41194)
