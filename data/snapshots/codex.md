## rust-v0.153.0 (2026-09-03T01:37:38Z)
## New Features

- Vim mode now supports undo with `u` and redo with `Ctrl+R`, preserving complete drafts including pasted content and attachments. ([#41941](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/41941), [#42140](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42140))
- The plugin CLI can list, install, and remove plugins from remote marketplaces. ([#42150](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42150))
- Set `tui.auto_recap = false` to disable automatic recaps while keeping manual `/recap` available. ([#42101](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42101))
- TUI history shows complete patches, input sent to background terminals, and individual completed commands. ([#41893](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/41893), [#42107](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42107))
- Plus and Team users receive an earlier warning when less than half of their allowance remains in an approximately five-hour usage window. ([#42142](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42142))

## Bug Fixes

- TUI sessions reconnect after an external app-server connection drops, preserving drafts and transcripts while keeping uncertain or queued submissions paused for review. ([#41911](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/41911), [#41916](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/41916), [#41918](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/41918))
- Full Access skips Guardian reviews for confirmation-only actions. User approval mode skips background Guardian scoring and prewarming, while sensitive-action checks and requests for user input retain their existing handling. ([#42147](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42147), [#42256](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42256))
- Guardian review history survives compaction, restarts, and user-created forks while respecting rollback boundaries and isolating subagent history. ([#41879](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/41879), [#42065](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42065))
- Remembered MCP tool approvals are scoped to the selected app account, and relative MCP executable paths start more reliably on macOS. ([#42133](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42133), [#42117](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42117))
- Rollout compression includes shared histories, `codex exec resume` handles compressed rollouts when selecting by working directory, and thread forks work with symlinked session roots. ([#42039](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42039), [#42135](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42135))

## Configuration and API Updates

- App-server thread metadata includes nullable `model` and `reasoningEffort` fields. Structured asynchronous questions are supported through `request_user_input_async` when enabled by the model catalog. ([#42151](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42151), [#42178](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42178))
- `tui.disable_paste_burst` replaces the top-level setting, which remains supported as a fallback. ([#41976](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/41976))
- Adds the disabled-by-default `features.context_management.experimental_mode` configuration. When enabled for eligible ChatGPT Plus, Pro, or Pro Lite sessions using the Codex backend, it activates token-budget context, history notes, and the `new_context` tool. API-key sessions, custom providers, and temporary structured threads remain excluded. ([#42385](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/42385))
